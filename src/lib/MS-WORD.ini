3) For this exercise, the correct values in each cell are important and will be graded.
4) The graph will be graded on appropriate content, appropriate axis scaling, and clear
labeling.
Content
You should form a table on a worksheet titled “class list” that includes the names and test
scores of your students. You have 7 students in your class, their names are: Allen, Borlin, Catlin,
Dorsey, Eugene, Finneran, and Greco. Their scores on the first 3 tests are as follows:
Test 1 Test 2 Test 3
Allen Test 89 Test 78 Test 89
Borlin Test 67 Test 56 Test 66
Catlin Test 78 Test 76 Test 76
Dorsey Test 56 Test 34 Test 45
Eugene Test 26 Test 100 Test 99
Finerran Test 99 Test 98 Test 97
Greco Test 78 Test 87 Test 88
I. Using an Excel function, show each student’s average in an additional column labeled
“Average”
II. Using an Excel function, show each student’s rounded average in an additional
column labeled “Rounded Average”
III. If a student’s rounded average is above “95”, he/she has received “honors” in the
class. In an additional column titled “Honors”, insert a function that will return the
word “Yes” if they have received honors, otherwise would return the word “No”
IV. If a student’s rounded average is 90 or greater, they receive an “A”. Between 80 and
90 is a “B”, between 70 and 80 is a “C”, between 60 and 70 is a “D”, and lower than
60 is an “F”. Somewhere on your sheet, enter this information in cells. Create an
additional column titled “Grade” and insert a nested IF function that returns the
appropriate grade for each student. Use an absolute cell references in your nested IF
function to indicate cut-off points between grades. Hint: You will need to place the
“cut-off grade” values in cells somewhere on your worksheet…
V. Below your table, create a graph showing the students’ rounded averages. Be sure to
include appropriate labeling and spacing, so that the graph is non-repetitive and the
scale is appropriate. Hint: A score of 100 is the highest possible…
VI. Insert a new worksheet. Use the Goal Seek feature to find the value that Eugene
needed on Test 1 in order to earn honors for the course. Show your work by
displaying an updated table. Title the worksheet “Eugene’s dream.” Hint: Do not
worry about rounding Eugene’s new “score” for Test 1. If done properly, the rest of
your table should update accordingly.
VII. From the data on your “class list” worksheet, provide the Descriptive Statistics of
your students’ rounded averages. For the output, create a new worksheet and choose
to display “summary statistics”. Rename this worksheet “Descriptive Statistics”.

PRACTICAL 4
function is a segment of code that accepts zero, one or more arguments and returns a single
result. Visual Basic includes many built-in functions (intrinsic functions). Some perform
basic mathematical tasks. Others manipulate string data such as converting text to upper
Case or lower Case letters. An argument is a value you pass to a function so the function
has data to work with. Function names have parentheses at the end to hold the function
arguments. Even if a function has no arguments, the parenthesis are required.
Two intrinsic functions include message boxes and input boxes.
Message and input boxes
Message and input boxes are intrinsic functions in Visual Basic 6.0 which allow the end user
to interact with the program. Follow the instructions Add new form to menu at the end of
Practical 1 to create a new form with a menu heading on the main form.
Call this “Message and Input Boxes”
Make the Form.Caption = “Message and Input Boxes”
Put a label on the top of the form “Computer Conversation”. Underneath have a
command button with the caption “Talk to me!” Name the command button cmdTalk.
Double click the command button to add the following code sequence.
Private Sub cmdTalk_Click()
Dim strQuestion As String
Dim intAnswer As Integer
‘First you must declare your variables’
‘Then use the input and message box functions’
strQuestion = InputBox(“Type in your name!”, “Ebeneezer”) intAnswer = MsgBox(“Hello
there” &strQuestion, vbOKCancel, “Chat”)
End Sub
Add a return button, called cmdBack as you did in the ColourChanger, using the code
Private Sub cmdBack_Click()
Form1.Show
End Sub
Run your program using <F5>. Don’t forget to save your work. Here are some handy
literals (values that don’t change). You don’t have to learn them as the help prompt supplies
a drop down list as you start to type.
PRACTICAL 5
Create a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers given by the user.
PRACTICAL 6
Write a program to convert inches to centimetres OR centimetres to inches (using the
conversion 1 inch = 2.54 centimetres).
Use option buttons (from the toolbox) for the user to indicate whether the conversion is
inches to centimetres or centimetres to inches.

selected. Option buttons are mutually exclusive, i.e. only one can be selected at a time.
